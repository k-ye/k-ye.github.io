I am a software engineer at Google Japan. I have a broad interest in infrastructure engineering, 
or any kind of big but clean problems, ranging from Paxos to ray tracing. It always excites me when 
a research literature is finally put into code.

I started at Google in Mountain View. Before that, I got my master degree from Harvard and B.S. from Tsinghua University.

I breathe C++ (since C++11, of course), not so much for Python (although I write it a lot). I have no idea how HTML5/CSS/JS works.
